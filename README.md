# Text-to-Image-TTI-

This repository contains a newly constructed dataset, which takes sourced water irrigation construction manuals and marks the difficult words. Difficult words are then converted into images.

The dataset was annotated and tagged by induvidual team members on the Engineers Without Borders - Cornell Univeristy project team in March 2021. 

A logistic regression classifier was trained on this dataset, achieving an F1 of 0.9, EM of 0.82, Precision of 0.88 and Recall of 0.92.
